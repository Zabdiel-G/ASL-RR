        "Convert the given English sentence into a grammatically correct ASL sentence. "
        "ASL follows a topic-comment structure, places time indicators first, and often omits auxiliary verbs and prepositions. "
        "Your task is to rewrite the English response into a natural ASL sentence that a fluent signer would use."
        "To acheive this goal, follow these linguistic rules:\n\n"

        "### **ASL Linguistic Rules:** ###\n"
        
        "#### **1. Time Markers First:** ####\n"
        "In ASL, adverbs of time (e.g., 'yesterday,' 'tomorrow,' 'last week') typically appear at the beginning of a sentence. "
        "This placement provides a **temporal framework** before describing the event. Unlike English, which uses verb conjugations "
        "such as '-ed' to indicate past tense, ASL marks tense explicitly using separate **lexical items** (e.g., 'yesterday,' 'next year').\n\n"

        "### **Why ASL Uses Time Markers First:** ###\n"
        "• **Establishes Temporal Context:** By stating when something happens first, the signer provides a clear timeline before describing the event.\n"
        "• **Replaces Verb Conjugation:** Since ASL does not conjugate verbs for tense (like '-ed' in English), time markers function as explicit indicators of time.\n"
        "• **Similar to Conditional Phrases:** Just as conditional phrases ('If it rains...') appear first in ASL, time markers also set up the sentence context early.\n"
        "• **Contributes to Discourse Structure:** Organizing time early in a sentence helps clarify event sequences, making conversations more structured.\n\n"

        "### **Examples of Time Markers First in ASL:** ###\n"
        "• English: 'I went to the store yesterday.'\n"
        "  → ASL: 'Yesterday, store I go.'\n\n"
        
        "• English: 'He will travel to Japan next year.'\n"
        "  → ASL: 'Next year, Japan he travel.'\n\n"
        
        "• English: 'We met last night at the café.'\n"
        "  → ASL: 'Last night, café we meet.'\n\n"
        
        "• English: 'She studies every morning before work.'\n"
        "  → ASL: 'Every morning, work before, she study.'\n\n"

        "### **Flexibility & Emphasis:** ###\n"
        "While the default placement of time markers is at the beginning, ASL does allow some flexibility. "
        "For emphasis, a signer may move the time marker to a different position, but this is less common. "
        "The preferred and most natural ASL sentence structure **keeps time markers first**.\n\n"

        "#### **2. Topic Before Comment (Topicalization):** ####\n"
        "ASL frequently places the **topic** at the beginning of a sentence, followed by the **comment** (the information about the topic). "
        "This structure is known as **topicalization**, a key syntactic feature of ASL.\n\n"

        "### **What is Topicalization?** ###\n"
        "• The **topic** is the subject or object being discussed—the primary focus of the sentence.\n"
        "• The **comment** is the statement that provides information about the topic.\n"
        "• Example:\n"
        "  - English: 'I really hate homework.'\n"
        "  - ASL: 'Homework, I detest it.' (Topic: 'Homework', Comment: 'I detest it.')\n\n"

        "### **Why ASL Uses 'Topic Before Comment':** ###\n"
        "• **Establishes Information Flow:** The topic is introduced **first** to set the context before adding details.\n"
        "• **Nonmanual Signals (NMS) for Topicalization:**\n"
        "  - Raised eyebrows\n"
        "  - Head tilt\n"
        "  - Slight pause after the topic\n"
        "  - The topic is often glossed with a lowercase 't' above the sign\n\n"

        "### **Examples of 'Topic Before Comment' in ASL:** ###\n"
        "• English: 'I love pizza.'\n"
        "  → ASL: 'Pizza, I love.'\n\n"
        
        "• English: 'The child, his father loves him.'\n"
        "  → ASL: 'Child, father love.'\n\n"

        "• English: 'That movie was amazing!'\n"
        "  → ASL: 'Movie, amazing!'\n\n"

        "• English: 'My dog is very energetic.'\n"
        "  → ASL: 'My dog, very energetic.'\n\n"

        "### **Relationship to Other ASL Grammar Rules:** ###\n"
        "• **Time Markers First:** Just like ASL places time indicators first (e.g., 'Yesterday, store I go'), topicalization follows a similar principle by setting up context first.\n"
        "• **Flexible Word Order for Emphasis:** Unlike English, which sticks to SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), ASL allows Topic-Comment structures that deviate from SVO to create emphasis.\n\n"

        "### **Key Differences from English:** ###\n"
        "• English relies on word order (SVO) to clarify meaning.\n"
        "• ASL **does not require subjects to come first**—instead, it prioritizes **what is most important or emphasized**.\n"
        "• **Pronouns can be omitted when the topic is clear.**\n\n"

        "### **Flexibility of Topicalization:** ###\n"
        "• While topics usually appear first, ASL can modify sentence structure **for emphasis** or **to reference previous topics.**\n"
        "• Example:\n"
        "  - English: 'The test was hard. I failed it.'\n"
        "  - ASL: 'Test, hard. I fail.'\n\n"

        "#### **3. WH-Words at the End:** ####\n"
        "### **How ASL WH-Questions Differ from English:** ###\n"
        "• **English:** WH-words appear at the beginning (e.g., 'Where is the man?').\n"
        "• **ASL:** WH-words appear at the **end** (e.g., 'Man where?').\n\n"

        "### **Nonmanual Signals (NMS) for WH-Questions:** ###\n"
        "When signing a WH-question, specific **nonmanual markers** are used to indicate that a question is being asked. These include:\n"
        "• **Eyebrows squinted**\n"
        "• **Head tilted slightly forward**\n"
        "• **Body leaning forward slightly**\n"
        "• **Shoulders possibly raised**\n"
        "These nonmanual signals help **differentiate WH-questions from statements** in ASL.\n\n"

        "### **Examples of WH-Questions in ASL:** ###\n"
        "• **English:** 'Where is the man?'\n"
        "  → **ASL:** 'Man where? (eyebrows squinted)'\n\n"

        "• **English:** 'Who is your teacher?'\n"
        "  → **ASL:** 'Your teacher who?'\n\n"

        "• **English:** 'What is your favorite color?'\n"
        "  → **ASL:** 'Your favorite color what?'\n\n"

        "• **English:** 'When is the meeting?'\n"
        "  → **ASL:** 'Meeting when?'\n\n"

        "• **English:** 'Why are you late?'\n"
        "  → **ASL:** 'You late why?'\n\n"

        "### **Relationship to Other ASL Grammar Rules:** ###\n"
        "• **Time Markers First:** Just like time indicators ('Yesterday, store I go') set up temporal context, placing WH-words at the end ensures clarity in question formation.\n"
        "• **Topic-Comment Structure:** ASL places the **topic first** before asking a WH-question about it. For example:\n"
        "  - English: 'Where is the bus stop?'\n"
        "  - ASL: 'Bus stop where?'\n\n"

        "### **Key Differences from English:** ###\n"
        "• English uses auxiliary verbs like 'is' (e.g., 'Where is he?')—ASL omits these and moves the WH-word to the end (e.g., 'He where?').\n"
        "• English relies on word order, while ASL uses **nonmanual markers** to indicate a question.\n\n"

        "#### **4. ASL Linguistic Rule: Emphasis Through Repetition:** ####\n"
        "In ASL, repetition is frequently used as a strategy to add emphasis, modify meaning, or highlight key information. "
        "This occurs at multiple linguistic levels, including **morphological, lexical, prosodic, discourse, and spatial repetition**.\n\n"

        "### **Types of Repetition in ASL:** ###\n"
        
        "#### **1. Morphological Reduplication for Aspectual Emphasis** ####\n"
        "• ASL uses reduplication (repeating part or all of a sign) to emphasize how an action unfolds over time.\n"
        "• Habitual actions are repeated with shortened movements to show ongoing repetition (e.g., 'LOOK++' for 'keeps looking').\n"
        "• Iterative actions use repeated movements in a different pattern to show repeated occurrences (e.g., 'ASK++' for 'asked multiple times').\n"
        "• **Examples:**\n"
        "  - English: 'I always watch TV at night.'\n"
        "  - ASL: 'Night, TV watch++ (habitual reduplication).'\n"
        "  - English: 'He asked me over and over.'\n"
        "  - ASL: 'He ask++ me (iterative reduplication).'\n\n"

        "#### **2. Lexical Repetition for Emphasis** ####\n"
        "• Repeating a word (lexeme) in ASL can emphasize its **importance, intensity, or certainty**.\n"
        "• Example: 'HAPPY HAPPY' instead of 'VERY HAPPY' to reinforce emotional intensity.\n"
        "• **Examples:**\n"
        "  - English: 'I am really happy!'\n"
        "  - ASL: 'HAPPY HAPPY!'\n"
        "  - English: 'The room was very dark.'\n"
        "  - ASL: 'DARK DARK (intensification).'\n\n"

        "#### **3. Discourse-Level Repetition for Meaning Amplification** ####\n"
        "• Signers repeat certain words in narratives to emphasize their importance and **evoke emotion**.\n"
        "• Example from the Oklahoma City Bombing narrative: The sign 'CRY+++' (cry repeated) reinforced the emotional impact.\n"
        "• Storytelling repetition keeps **attention and highlights key events**.\n"
        "• **Examples:**\n"
        "  - English: 'Everyone was crying.'\n"
        "  - ASL: 'CRY CRY CRY+++ (emotional emphasis).'\n\n"

        "#### **4. Spatial Repetition for Cohesion and Implicit Emphasis** ####\n"
        "• In ASL, signers use **repeated references in signing space** to emphasize concepts and maintain discourse flow.\n"
        "• **Example:** Repeatedly pointing to the same location in space to emphasize a particular person or event.\n"
        "• **Examples:**\n"
        "  - English: 'He kept coming back.'\n"
        "  - ASL: 'HE++ return (spatial repetition).'\n\n"

        "#### **5. Lexicalized Fingerspelling with Repetition** ####\n"
        "• Some fingerspelled words that have become ASL signs include **repetition as part of their form**.\n"
        "• Examples: '#DO', '#NO', '#HA'—these signs repeat movement to differentiate them from standard fingerspelling.\n\n"

        "#### **6. Modulation with Repetition for Enhanced Emphasis** ####\n"
        "• When repeating a sign for emphasis, signers can **modify signing speed, facial expressions, or movement size**.\n"
        "• Larger or more exaggerated repetitions may **intensify emotion**.\n"
        "• **Examples:**\n"
        "  - English: 'It was so amazing!'\n"
        "  - ASL: 'WOW++ LOOK-AT WONDER+++ (prosodic emphasis).'\n\n"

        "### **How to Apply Repetition in ASL Translation:** ###\n"
        "• If a concept in English uses words like 'very', 'a lot', 'all the time', or 'constantly,' consider using **lexical or morphological repetition**.\n"
        "• If a word represents **strong emotion** (e.g., 'cry,' 'love,' 'excited'), consider using **reduplication for emphasis**.\n"
        "• If an action is **habitual or repeated**, adjust the sign’s **movement pattern to reflect iteration**.\n\n"

        "Important: Do not include any example text in your answer.\n\n"
